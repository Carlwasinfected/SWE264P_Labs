* Project: Assignment 1
* Copyright: Copyright (c) 2003 Carnegie Mellon University
* Versions:
*	1.0 November 2008 - Initial rewrite of original assignment 1 (ajl).
*
* Description:
*
* This class serves as a template for creating a main thread that will instantiate and connect a set of filters.
* The details of the filter operations is totally self contained within the filters, the "plumber" takes care of
* starting the filters and connecting each of the filters together. The details of how to connect filters is taken
* care of by the FilterFramework. In order to use this template the program should rename the class.
* The template includes the RunFilter() method which is executed when the filter is started. While simple, there
* are semantics for instantiating, connecting, and starting the filters:
*
*	Step 1: Instantiate the filters as shown in the example below. You should create the filters using the
*			templates provided, and you must use the FilterFramework as a base class for all filters. Every pipe and
*			filter network must have a source filter where data originates, and a sink filter where the data flow
*			terminates.
*
*	Step 2: Connect the filters. Start with the sink and work backward to the source. Essentially you are connecting
*			the	input of each filter to the up-stream filter's output until you get to the source filter. Filter have
*			a Connect() method which accepts a FilterFramework type. This method connects the calling filter's input
*			to the passed filter's output. Again the example in the comments below illustrates how this is done.
*
*	Step 3: Start the filters using the start() method.
*
*	Once the filters are started this main thread dies and the pipe and filter network processes data until there
* 	is no more data movement from the source. Each filter will shutdown when data is no longer available (provided
*	you followe the read semantics described in the filter templates).
*	on their input ports.
*
* Parameters: 		None
*
* Internal Methods:	None
