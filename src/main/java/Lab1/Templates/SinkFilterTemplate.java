* File:SinkFilterTemplate.java
* Project: Assignment 1
* Copyright: Copyright (c) 2003 Carnegie Mellon University
* Versions:
*	1.0 November 2008 - Initial rewrite of original assignment 1 (ajl).
*
* Description:
*
* This class serves as a template for creating sink filters. The details of threading, connections writing output
* are contained in the FilterFramework super class. In order to use this template the program should rename the class.
* The template includes the run() method which is executed when the filter is started.
* The run() method is the guts of the filter and is where the programmer should put their filter specific code.
* In the template there is a main read-write loop for reading from the input port of the filter. The programmer is
* responsible for writing the data to a file, or device of some kind. This template assumes that the filter is a sink
* filter that reads data from the input file and writes the output from this filter to a file or device of some kind.
* In this case, only the input port is used by the filter. In cases where the filter is a standard filter or a source
* filter, you should use the FilterTemplate.java or the SourceFilterTemplate.java as a starting point for creating
* standard or source filters.
*
* Parameters: 		None
*
* Internal Methods:
*
*	public void run() - this method must be overridden by this class.
