* File:SourceFilterTemplate.java
* Project: Assignment 1
* Copyright: Copyright (c) 2003 Carnegie Mellon University
* Versions:
*	1.0 November 2008 - Initial rewrite of original assignment 1 (ajl).
*
* Description:
*
* This class serves as a template for creating source filters. The details of threading, connections writing output
* are contained in the FilterFramework super class. In order to use this template the program should rename the class.
* The template includes the run() method which is executed when the filter is started. The run() method is the guts
* of the filter and is where the programmer should put their filter specific code.The run() method is the main
* read-write loop for reading data from some source and writing to the output port of the filter. This template
* assumes that the filter is a source filter that reads data from a file, device (sensor),or generates the data
* interally, and then writes data to its output port. In this case, only the output port is used. In cases where the
* filter is a standard filter or a sink filter, you should use the FilterTemplate.java or SinkFilterTemplate.java as
* a starting point for creating standard or sink filters.
*
* Parameters: 		None
*
* Internal Methods:
*
*	public void run() - this method must be overridden by this class.

*	The programer can insert code for the filter operations
* 	here to include reading the data from some device or file.
*   Note that regardless how the data is read, data must
*	be sent one byte at a time out the output pipe. This has
* 	been done to adhere to the pipe and filter paradigm and
*	provide a high degree of portabilty between filters.
*	However, you must convert input data to byte type on your
*	own. The following line of code will write a byte of data
*	out the filter's output port. If you break from the loop
* 	you should call ClosePorts() to close the filter ports in an
* 	orderly way. This is shown below, but commented out. Where
* 	you close the ports will depend upon how you terminate the
*	loop.
